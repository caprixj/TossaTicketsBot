*Ticketo-chan* (ukrainian: –¢—ñ–∫–µ—Ç–æ-—Ç—è–Ω–æ—á–∫–∞) is a Telegram bot for automating *Ticketonomics* processes.  
_Note that the bot is hosted on the developer's phone, so it may not always be available._

*Ticketonomics* is a game system based on *tickets* (in-game currency). More info and updates are available in the Telegram channel *TossaTickets* (https://t.me/+q66chy227wk5MWQy)

ü™¨ To join Ticketonomics, you must become part of our Community by joining the Telegram group *Spaceflight Simulator üá∫üá¶* (@spaceflight\_simulator\_chat), and send the /reg command to Ticketo-chan.

*üìä Learn about participants and leaderboards*

*‚Ä¢ Member info*: Reply to one's message with `/infm`, or provide one's username or ID: `/infm [username/id]`  
*‚Ä¢ Check member's assets*: Reply with `/bal`, or provide one's username or ID: `/bal [username/id]`  
*‚Ä¢ View member's awards*: Use the `/laward` command. Works the same as `/bal`  
*‚Ä¢ View your transfer history*: Use the `/ltrans` command  
*‚Ä¢ Ticket leaderboard*: Get the full list with `/topt`. For a trimmed list, provide a positive number, or for the anti-leaderboard, a negative number: `/topt [number]`  
*‚Ä¢ Leaderboard by ticket share*: Similar to `/topt` but shown in percentages: `/topt % [number]`
